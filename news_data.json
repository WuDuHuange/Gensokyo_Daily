          "summary": "&nbsp; &quot;Happy Valentine's!&quot; &nbsp; &quot;...&quot; Merry stared at Renko and the heart-shaped box of chocolates for a few moments, looking unimpressed. &quot;Here I thought we're actually gonna do something today...&quot; &nbsp; &quot;Come on, just accept it, Merry. Geez, you're hurting a maiden's heart, here~&quot; &nbsp; Merry snatched the box with a teasing smirk. &quot;'Maiden', she says...&quot; &nbsp; &quot;Am I not?&quot; &nbsp; &quot;You're the last girl I think of when I hear the word 'maiden'.&quot; &nbsp; Renko slouched. &quot;Somehow... that hurt me way more than I thought it would...&quot; She slumped into the coffee table. &quot;Ahh, Merry, I'm bleeding out energy. Quick, I need chocolates to heal...&quot; &nbsp; &quot;...You want to eat the chocolates you just gifted me?&quot; &nbsp; Renko's eyes flicked up to Merry. &quot;No,&quot; she replied, sitting back upright, then reaching out her hand. &nbsp; Merry looked at it for a moment, then grabbed it and shook it. &nbsp; Renko drew away. &quot;I'm not asking for a handshake!&quot; &nbsp; Merry giggled. &quot;I know, I know, I'm sorry. I didn't get you any chocolates today.&quot; &nbsp; &quot;And how long have we been friends for? You're cruel, Merry.&quot; &nbsp; &quot;Sorry, sorry,&quot; she replied as she popped open Renko's gift and started eating the chocolates. &nbsp; Renko stared at her hand for a few moments. The moment Merry's fingers grabbed another piece of chocolate, Renko suddenly lunged forward, grabbed her hand, and munched the chocolate right off of it. ** &nbsp; &quot;Is that really true?&quot; Merry's eyes were narrowed. &nbsp; &quot;Of course! Look it up, 'chocolate of fate'. Two pieces of chocolate that, when eaten by two people, binds their souls forever.&quot; &nbsp; &quot;That sounds strangely nefarious...&quot; &nbsp; &quot;Well... it is a curse. It's something that manifests in a random piece of chocolate anywhere in the world. Kind of like a Devil Fruit from that old manga. What was it called again?&quot; &nbsp; &quot;A curse, huh? How romantic.&quot; &nbsp; &quot;Yep. Nothing is more romantic than being cursed together and struggling through it together, right?&quot; &nbsp; Merry's mouth opened, but she stopped the words before they could exit. She turned away. &nbsp; Renko's eyes narrowed. &quot;I know what you were gonna say.&quot; &nbsp; &quot;What?&quot; &nbsp; &quot;That Hifuu is like a curse that binds you to me?&quot; &nbsp; &quot;...&quot; &nbsp; Renko sighed. &quot;If there's anything nefarious here, it's your teasing, Merry.&quot; &nbsp; They eventually reached a little sweets shop. It looked humble; just a little store the width of an alley, tucked between two larger buildings. &quot;Alright. Come on, Merry.&quot; Renko gestured for Merry to go to the counter. &nbsp; &quot;...What?&quot; &nbsp; &quot;Buy one.&quot; &nbsp; &quot;Me? This whole thing was your idea. Why am I the one buying chocolates?&quot; &nbsp; &quot;Well I bought you chocolates, right?&quot; &nbsp; Merry's eyes narrowed. &quot;Do you just want me to treat you, or is this revenge for not having a gift for you?&quot; &nbsp; &quot;I'll give you money. Go buy some.&quot; &nbsp; &quot;So this is revenge...&quot; ** &nbsp; Renko hummed away, smiling brightly, as she held a bag full of chocolates in her arms. Merry walked by her side, looking unimpressed. &quot;Why did we have to go to multiple stores...&quot; &nbsp; &quot;I told you, it's so that we can get a ton of chocolates to increase the likelihood that we get the cursed chocolate.&quot; &nbsp; Merry's eyes narrowed. &quot;Normally, you'd say 'If it manifests into random pieces, wouldn't it be better to just buy chocolate in bulk and cut them up into tiny pieces?'&quot; &nbsp; &quot;Really? You’re saying I'd pass up on an adventure?&quot; &nbsp; &quot;Would you call this an adventure?&quot; &nbsp; Renko pointed her beaming smile at Merry. &quot;Well, I had fun.&quot; &nbsp; &quot;Well, you had your revenge, so-&quot; &nbsp; &quot;Come on, that's not what I meant! I don't really care much about the chocolate giving part of Valentine's. The revenge is fun, but… you know...&quot; &nbsp; &quot;Then what is it?&quot; &nbsp; &quot;W-well...&quot; Renko turned away, blushing. &nbsp; Merry tilted her head. &quot;What?&quot; &nbsp; &quot;It's... nothing.&quot; &nbsp; Eventually, night fell. The quiet dark was occasionally broken up by the sound of lone crickets. In a little side street, far out from Kyoto's bustling centre, were the two halves of Hifuu, passing by one street lamp after the other. They were each carrying a bag full of chocolates. &nbsp; Soon, exhaustion forced them to rest on the nearest bench. The moment they sat, they simultaneously let out a sigh of relief. It made them both giggle through the panting. &nbsp; &quot;Why... pant- how... how do you have so much money, Renko?&quot; &nbsp; Renko smirked. &quot;I was prepared~&quot; &nbsp; &quot;Is that so...&quot; Merry said, before taking out her phone. It was already 1 AM. &quot;I have to go soon. Let’s get rested up quick. Your apartment's pretty close now, right?&quot; &nbsp; Suddenly, she felt a tug on her sleeve. Renko's fingers held it tight... &nbsp; &quot;...What?&quot; Merry asked. &nbsp; Renko turned away. &quot;Umm... can we maybe... try eating these chocolates here?&quot; &nbsp; &quot;Huh? All of this?&quot; &nbsp; Renko nodded, still facing away. &quot;It's the only way we can tell if we got the cursed chocolate or not. Remember what I said? Its indistinguishable from normal chocolate.&quot; &nbsp; Merry's eyes narrowed. &quot;All right, just spit it out.&quot; &nbsp; &quot;...What do you mean?&quot; &nbsp; &quot;Renko, I take psych classes, but even that isn't needed to see how weirdly you've been acting today.&quot; &nbsp; &quot;...&quot; &nbsp; &quot;If you don't tell me, I'm gonna leave you here.&quot; &nbsp; Renko immediately turned to her. &quot;Wait, wait, wait, I'll tell you, I'll tell you!&quot; &nbsp; Merry crossed her arms. &quot;Go on.&quot; &nbsp; A blush took over Renko's cheeks. &quot;...Can we eat least try eating some of the chocolate while I talk?&quot; &nbsp; Merry sighed. &quot;...Fine.&quot; ** &nbsp; &quot;Remember when I told you I don't particularly care about the chocolate-giving parts of valentines?&quot; Renko said, staring at a piece of chocolate between her fingers; the lamplight's glow made its edges shine. &nbsp; &quot;Yeah?&quot; Merry said as she munched on her own piece. &nbsp; The piece on Renko's fingers began to melt a little. &quot;I... wanted to... you know, spend time with you.&quot; &nbsp; Merry ripped open a KitKat. &quot;What do you mean? Speak clearly.&quot; &nbsp; &quot;...&quot; &nbsp; Merry sighed. She took a bite of the KitKat. &quot;I have a good guess of what you're trying to say. If you don't just say it, I'll say it for you. Got it?&quot; &nbsp; &quot;...You're nefarious, Merry.&quot; &nbsp; &quot;You're the one who tugged me along because you wanted to spend more time with me. That's why you kept stringing me along all day, right?&quot; &nbsp; Renko flinched a little. The piece she held fell on the box, coating the various plastics glittering under the lamplight. She quickly picked it back up again. &quot;Well... yeah. Although I don't really care about the chocolates... the date part of valentines, well...&quot; &nbsp; &quot;You should've just asked me out.&quot; &nbsp; &quot;I was scared! What if... what if you didn't want to go out with another girl?&quot; &nbsp; &quot;Well, I mean, we go out all the time, right?&quot; &nbsp; &quot;...I wanted this one to be different.&quot; &nbsp; &quot;Well, in the end, it ended up being pretty much the same as usual,&quot; Merry said, eating yet another pack of chocolates. &nbsp; Renko turned. &quot;...You're eating a lot.&quot; &nbsp; Merry glared. &quot;You're the one who told me to start eating.&quot; &nbsp; Renko shrank back. &quot;Ah, s-sorry...&quot; she said, then started eating chocolates herself. &nbsp; &quot;Don't be,&quot; Merry replied. &quot;Another reason I'm eating these is that they're your Valentine’s presents to me. I have to show my appreciation by eating them at least, right?&quot; &nbsp; &quot;Y-yeah...&quot; Renko said, taking out the same brand of chocolate Merry had just opened up. &nbsp; Now it was Merry's turn to turn away. &quot;And also... you know... if we do happen to eat the cursed chocolate... it would be nice,&quot; she said, blushing a little. &nbsp; And the two of them took a bite off the same chocolate at the same time. &nbsp; The lamplight above flickered a little. &nbsp; &quot;Y-yeah...&quot; Renko said. Silence fell. &nbsp; Merry split a chocolate bar, breaking the silence. &quot;It's better to go through something terrible like a curse with someone else. It forms a stronger bond. Makes it much more exciting and comfortable.&quot; &nbsp; Renko nodded along. &nbsp; &quot;But inversely...&quot; Merry's voice trailed off, &quot;It's terrible to go through a curse all alone.&quot; &nbsp; Renko's eyes widened. Boundaries; strange rifts in reality; monstrous eyes that appear on a full moon: things which only Merry seemed to be able to see, from as far back as her first memory all the way to the present. She had always been alone with it. But now... &nbsp; Merry smiled. &quot;Renko... will you continue to accompany me... through even this curse?&quot; &nbsp; For a moment, Renko froze. But she eventually forced a smile and broke through the ice, like always. She grabbed Merry's hand and turned to her. The feeling of Renko's warmth made Merry turn, too. &nbsp; &quot;Of course I will,&quot; Renko said, as the two of them exchanged stares, &quot;After all, Hifuu will always be one in two!&quot; &nbsp; Merry giggled. &quot;Looks like we never needed that cursed chocolate, then, huh?&quot;  &#32; submitted by &#32;  /u/Brick-Stonesonn   [link] &#32; [comments]",

          "summary": "With Gensokyo Chronicles' Finale coming, I decided to come with the plot that may or may not contradict what u/Red-Chev planned. So here is how it goes: First off, the dark lord is revealed to be Mima, and the first phase of the plan is to kidnap all the Incident Resolvers and anyone who interferes with the plan and have their powers sealed in a container. Then the PC-98 characters are rallied up and the second phase of the plan begins. Just when all hope seems lost, Gappy of all people rescues everyone and restores their powers. With everyone free, the Final Battle begins! The battle ends with Mima sealed away for good, and Megumu and Okina losing their powers. Refusing to accept defeat, the duo find a way to make a volcano erupt, planning destroy Gensokyo. Needing a way to stop the eruption, Gappy offers to sacrifice himself to stop it. The heroes were reluctant about it at first but eventually agreed. With his final words, Gappy jumps in and sacrifices himself to stop the eruption. With the eruption stopped, peace returned to Gensokyo. Megumu and Okina are either banished from Gensokyo or punished severely for the troubles they caused. A statue of Gappy was built in memorial and everyone goes on with their lives. u/Red-Chev then thanks everybody for reading his doujins and bids farewell. So what do you guys think?  &#32; submitted by &#32;  /u/Playful-Bullfrog-470   [link] &#32; [comments]",
